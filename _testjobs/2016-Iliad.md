Enhanced automated test framework adding REST API querying on top of Selenium and SQL. This simplified the insertion of data across multiple databases and reduced the time to gather results. Created libraries for efficiently extracting and filtering data from multi-page web result tables speeding test execution time.

Introduced Postman for API testing allowing the verification of interfaces created for a new front-end. This decoupled interface testing from the front-end allows tests suites to be built into automated regression tests.

Worked with developers to increase testability of T3 Switchâ€™s internal functions.

Created containerised versions and configurations of existing test environments to ease testing of feature-branch based development. Cross-trained test team with docker usage.

Brought physical build monitors into the office allowing simple status reporting of automated build and reducing the time between failure and resolution.
